# main.py

The `main.py` file is the entry point of the application, responsible for initializing the FastAPI server and including the routes defined in other modules.

## Code Structure

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from doclearn.api.routes import router

app = FastAPI()

# Includes the routes defined in the routes module
app.include_router(router)
```



### Imports

- `FastAPI`: Main class that creates the application.
- `router`: Object containing the defined routes, imported from the `routes` module.

### Application Initialization

- `app = FastAPI()`: Creates an instance of the FastAPI application.

### Route Inclusion

- `app.include_router(router)`: Adds the routes defined in the `routes` module to the application. This allows the application to respond to HTTP requests on the specified routes.

## Considerations

This file is essential for the application's operation, as it configures the server and the routes that will be used. Make sure that the routes in the `routes` module are correctly defined to ensure proper API functionality.
