# api

The `api` directory is responsible for managing the project's API routes. It contains all the endpoints that allow interaction with the system's resources. The structure of this directory is designed to facilitate maintenance and scalability of the application.

## Directory Structure

- **routes.py**: This file contains the definition of the API routes, including HTTP methods and corresponding request handlers.

## Considerations

- Ensure that all routes are properly documented and tested.
- Maintain the organization of routes to facilitate navigation and code comprehension.
